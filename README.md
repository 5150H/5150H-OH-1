## Updates and other information:

### 10/20/2023 (before meeting)

I have been trying to get pros to work for the past few days now. I have no idea why it doesn't work. 

I have tried the following things:

- Create a new new project
- Reinstall the extention
- Update the extention
- Use a previous version
- Follow the trail of errors and fix it myself

I am going to try the following when I can:

- Compare files with a friend
- Use the friend's files and reinit main.cpp
- use a different laptop

I hope that something will work because I'm very quickly starting to panic.

#### UPDATE:

I brought my personal laptop, everything works perfectly now. I'm going to try to get as much done before the meeting right now.

I'm currently going through the process of using LimLib, a library for PID and other QoL stuff.
