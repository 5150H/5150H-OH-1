## Updates and other information:

10/20/2023 (day before comp 1)

I have been trying to get pros to work for the past few days now. I have no idea why it doesn't work. 

I have tried the following things:

- Create a new new project
- Reinstall the extention
- Update the extention
- Use a previous version
- Follow the trail of errors and fix it myself

I am going to try the following when I can:

- Compare files with a friend
- Use the friend's files and reinit main.cpp
- use a different laptop

I hope that something will work because I'm very quickly starting to panic.
